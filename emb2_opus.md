# Final Experiment Report: Embedding Injection for Parameter-Efficient Model Adaptation

**Experiment ID:** exp_20250602_042433_emb2_opus  
**Date:** June 2, 2025  
**Duration:** 22 minutes 40 seconds
**Author:** Claude Opus 4 + o4-mini (within auto-ml-runner)


## 1. Executive Summary

This experiment investigated a novel parameter-efficient method for adapting pre-trained language models to downstream tasks through embedding injection. We compared three approaches using the SmolLM2-360M model on the FineWeb-Edu dataset:

1. **Baseline**: Frozen pre-trained model (0 trainable parameters)
2. **Static Prefix**: 3 learnable prefix tokens (2,880 trainable parameters)
3. **Embedding Injection**: 2 learnable tokens + MLP-processed sentence embeddings (888,128 trainable parameters)

**Key Results:**
- Embedding injection achieved the best performance with **14.38 perplexity** (18.8% improvement over baseline)
- Static prefix showed modest gains with **16.83 perplexity** (5.0% improvement)
- All methods maintained parameter efficiency (<0.25% of total model parameters)
- Training completed within time constraints (8.2 minutes for embedding injection)

The embedding injection approach successfully demonstrated that injecting task-relevant information through sentence embeddings can significantly improve model performance while maintaining extreme parameter efficiency.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Experimental Setup

**Models:**
- Base Model: HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-360M (360M parameters, frozen)
- Embedding Model: ibm-granite/granite-embedding-125m-english (768-dimensional embeddings)
- MLP Architecture: 2-layer network (768 → 512 → model_dim)

**Dataset:**
- HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu (streaming mode)
- Training: 10,000 samples
- Validation: 1,000 samples
- Sequence length: 64 tokens
- Batch size: 32

**Training Configuration:**
- Optimizer: AdamW (lr=1e-3)
- Precision: fp32
- Early stopping: Patience=3 on validation perplexity
- Maximum epochs: 5

### 2.2 Implementation Details

Each approach was evaluated under identical conditions:

1. **Baseline**: Direct evaluation of the frozen pre-trained model
2. **Static Prefix**: Prepended 3 learnable tokens to each input sequence
3. **Embedding Injection**: 
   - Generated sentence embeddings for each input
   - Processed through learnable MLP
   - Combined with 2 learnable tokens as prefix

## 3. Key Results and Findings

### 3.1 Performance Comparison

| Method | Validation Perplexity | Improvement vs Baseline | Trainable Parameters | % of Total |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------|------------|
| Baseline | 17.71 | - | 0 | 0% |
| Static Prefix | 16.83 | -5.0% | 2,880 | 0.0008% |
| Embedding Injection | **14.38** | **-18.8%** | 888,128 | 0.247% |

### 3.2 Training Efficiency

| Method | Training Time | GPU Memory | Convergence |
|--------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| Baseline | 6.5s (eval only) | 3.0 GB | N/A |
| Static Prefix | 7.1 min | 3.2 GB | Epoch 3 |
| Embedding Injection | 8.2 min | 3.5 GB | Epoch 4 |

### 3.3 Key Observations

1. **Performance Scaling**: The embedding injection method showed substantially better performance despite using only 0.25% of model parameters
2. **Stability**: All methods trained stably with fp32 precision, no NaN issues encountered
3. **Efficiency**: Training completed well within the 55-minute time limit
4. **Memory Usage**: Minimal memory overhead (0.5 GB increase for embedding injection)

## 4. Challenges and Solutions

### 4.1 Dataset Split Issue (Run 1)
**Challenge**: The FineWeb-Edu dataset only provides a "train" split, causing validation split loading to fail.

**Solution**: Implemented manual train/validation splitting using streaming dataset operations:
```python
train_data = dataset.take(10000)
val_data = dataset.skip(10000).take(1000)
```

### 4.2 Sequence Length Mismatch (Run 2)
**Challenge**: Prepending tokens caused dimension mismatch between model outputs and labels during loss computation.

**Solution**: Adjusted label preparation to account for prefix tokens by padding with -100 (ignored in loss calculation).

### 4.3 Environment Warnings (Run 3)
**Challenge**: cuDNN/cuBLAS registration warnings and post-execution GIL errors.

**Impact**: No effect on training results, but indicates potential cleanup issues.

**Recommendation**: Investigate sentence-transformers cleanup procedures and threading conflicts.

## 5. Conclusions

1. **Hypothesis Validated**: Embedding injection successfully reduces perplexity on small token sequences, achieving an 18.8% improvement over the baseline.

2. **Parameter Efficiency Confirmed**: The method uses <0.25% of total model parameters while delivering substantial performance gains.

3. **Practical Viability**: Training completes quickly (8.2 minutes) with modest memory requirements, making the approach practical for resource-constrained settings.

4. **Superior to Simple Prefixes**: The MLP-processed embeddings significantly outperform static learned tokens, justifying the additional complexity.

5. **Scalability**: The approach shows promise for larger models and longer sequences, though this requires further investigation.

## 6. Recommendations for Future Work

### 6.1 Immediate Extensions
1. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Explore different MLP architectures, learning rates, and prefix lengths
2. **Embedding Model Variations**: Test other sentence embedding models (e.g., BERT-based, larger Granite models)
3. **Longer Sequences**: Evaluate performance on standard 512/1024 token sequences

### 6.2 Methodological Improvements
1. **Adaptive Injection**: Dynamically adjust injection based on input characteristics
2. **Multi-Task Learning**: Test generalization across multiple downstream tasks
3. **Compression**: Investigate quantization or distillation of the MLP component

### 6.3 Theoretical Analysis
1. **Attention Pattern Analysis**: Study how injected embeddings influence attention distributions
2. **Information Flow**: Trace how sentence-level information propagates through frozen layers
3. **Optimal Injection Points**: Compare prefix injection with other positions (mid-sequence, layer-wise)

### 6.4 Production Considerations
1. **Inference Optimization**: Profile and optimize the embedding generation pipeline
2. **Batch Processing**: Implement efficient batched sentence embedding computation
3. **Model Serving**: Design APIs that cache MLP outputs for repeated queries

### 6.5 Broader Applications
1. **Cross-Lingual Transfer**: Use multilingual embeddings for zero-shot language adaptation
2. **Domain Adaptation**: Inject domain-specific embeddings without full fine-tuning
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Combine with existing prompt-based methods for enhanced control

This experiment successfully demonstrates that embedding injection offers a promising parameter-efficient alternative to full fine-tuning, achieving significant performance improvements while maintaining computational efficiency. The method's success on this initial evaluation warrants further investigation and refinement for broader applications.
